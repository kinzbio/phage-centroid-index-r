# phage-centroid-index-r
An R implementation of [Hosseini's (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06379-z) Centroid Index metric for assessing phage growth efficiency.

This repo contains a single executable script, which can be run from the terminal, and an example dataset. It is not an R package, although it could be in the future.

## Important
The script assumes the `csv` file has the same layout as returned by the Infitek'sÂ® spectrophotometer we have at Kinzbio. Should be easy to adapt to your own need. 

## Usage
```
Usage
=====
 ./centroid_index.r [options]


Options
=======
--help, -h
                Show this help message and exit

--input=INPUT, -i INPUT
                Path to csv file with OD measurements. Assumes Infitek's spectrophotometer output layout.

--time_column=TIME_COLUMN, -t TIME_COLUMN
                The name of the time column.

--control_column=CONTROL_COLUMN, -c CONTROL_COLUMN
                The name of the control column.

--eval_columns=EVAL_COLUMNS, -e EVAL_COLUMNS
                The name of the column to evaluate. Can be more than one, should be passed separated by comma and quoted: "B4,B5,B6".

--plot=PLOT, -p PLOT
                If provided, the name to the plot file (png). If not provided, the plotting is avoided.
```
# Example
This repo comes with a `csv` file example, for testing and for if you need to replicate the format. 

```
./centroid_index.r \
    --input ./inst/extdata/exampleOD.csv \
    --time_column "Time" \
    --control_column "C10" \
    --eval_columns "C4,C5,C6,C7,C8"
```
Result (printed in console):
